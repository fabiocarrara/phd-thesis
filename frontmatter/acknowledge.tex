\lettrine{I}{} had the luck and pleasure to be surrounded by wonderful people during my Ph.D. career. Most of them do not even know that without them the reader would not be keeping this thesis in her or his hands.

First and foremost, I would like to express my immense gratitude to Dr. Giuseppe Amato and Dr. Claudio Gennaro, that offered me this opportunity, supported me, and advised me with patience during the research activities and the writing of this thesis. Without them, I would have not started nor ended this journey.

A special thank goes also to Dr. Fabrizio Falchi, with whom I collaborated closely in most of the research activities of my Ph.D. I am sincerely grateful for the invaluable help provided and the delightful discussions upon science, music, food, books, and much more is worth living for.

I gratefully acknowledge Prof. Francesco Marcelloni for supervising my Ph.D., and Prof. Michel Crucianu and Prof. Nicu Sebe that took the time to evaluate my work and provide valuable feedback.

I would like to thank the Networked Multimedia Information Systems lab for giving me the opportunity to join its team, especially Dr. Fausto Rabitti for the funding opportunities for trips and hardware.
I am sincerely grateful to all my lab mates for the three years spent together --- I really enjoyed my time at the CNR because of you.

Last but not least, incommensurable gratefulness is due to my girlfriend Regina, who stood next to me during the entire journey,
